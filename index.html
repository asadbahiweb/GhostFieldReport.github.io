					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<p>The <span>GH-01 well in the GHOST field is a dry gas well located in Badin Sindh, Pakistan.</span> The well is situated in sandstone geological formations at a depth of 8540 ft, with an initial reservoir pressure of 4600 psig and a temperature of 170 °F.To estimate the reserves and predict production for the GH-01 well, <span>three different methods were applied volumetric reserve estimation, material balance, and declined curve analysis</span>. Each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations, and by combining the results from multiple methods, we can improve the reliability and precision of our estimates.To apply volumetric reserve estimation to the GH-01 well, we collected geological data on the porosity and thickness of the reservoir rock, as well as data on the gas content of the rock. We used this data to calculate the gas reserves in the well using a volumetric equation. Based on this method, we estimate that the GH-01 well has a total of <span>1231 Bscf of gas in place</span>.To apply material balance to the GH-01 well, we collected data on the composition of the gas, the reservoir pressure and temperature, and the well characteristics, including the diameter and length of the wellbore, the number and size of perforations, and the skin factor. We used this data to calculate the gas in place and recoverable reserves for the well using a material balance equation. Our analysis indicated that the GH-01 well has a total <span>1249 bscf  gas in place.</span>To apply declined curve analysis to the GH-01 well, we collected production data for the well over a period of time and used this data to fit a decline curve model. The model takes into account the decline in production due to the depletion of the reservoir, as well as any changes in well performance or operating conditions. Based on this model, we estimate that the GH-01 well has the <span>potential to produce a total of 1180 Bscf of gas reserves</span>.Overall, our analysis suggests that the GH-01 well has a significant potential for gas production, with <span>estimated reserves ranging from 1180 Bscf to 1246 Bscf, depending on the method used.</span> However, it is important to note that these estimates are subject to various assumptions and limitations, including the quality of the data and the accuracy of the models applied. For example,<span>the declined curve analysis assumes that the decline in production follows a predictable pattern, the material balance requires detailed and accurate data on the reservoir and well characteristics, and the volumetric reserve estimation assumes that the reservoir rock has a uniform porosity and gas content.</span></p>

				<h1>Introduction of Reservoir</h1>
			
				<p>The Ghost gas field is located in Badin district of Sindh province, Pakistan and was discovered in 1999. This field is an example of a high-pressure, subsurface rock formation that contains natural gas, located in a sandstone geologic formation at a depth of 8,540 ft. The Ghost gas field's production began in 2001, utilizing modern drilling techniques to extract the natural gas from the reservoir. The field is notable for being a significant source of energy, used for heating and power generation, as well as for transportation.</p>
			
				<p>Due to high pressure, special care has to be taken while drilling, completing and operating the wells in the field. Also, advanced production techniques may be required to handle the high pressure and bring the gas to the surface. The reservoir contains a large volume of natural gas that is extracted through the wells drilled into the formation.</p>
			
				<p>The Ghost gas field has been a major contributor to the energy sector of Pakistan since its production started. The field's exploration and development history is a testament to the advances in technology and the expertise of the operators. The Ghost gas field is owned and operated by a <span>National Oil and Gas company of Pakistan</span>. With the continued efforts of the operator, the field is expected to continue production and provide a steady supply of natural gas for many years to come.</p>

				<h1>Introduction of Well</h1>
				<p>The GH 1 well is a strategically important well, situated in the Ghost gas field of Sindh, Pakistan. It was drilled to a depth of 8540 ft, targeting a high-pressure, natural gas-bearing sandstone formation. The well is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and techniques to ensure maximum production efficiency. The wellhead pressure of 150 PSIG and separator pressure of 90 PSIG, shows that the well is designed to handle high pressure and flow rate. The well began production with an initial flow rate of 123 MMSCF/D, providing a significant contribution to the overall production and supply of natural gas for the region. The well is owned and operated by a national oil and gas company of Pakistan, which is known for its expertise in the exploration and production of oil and gas resources. The GH 1 well has been in production since its completion and is expected to continue to provide a steady supply of natural gas for many years to come. This well represents an essential step in the development of the Ghost gas field, as it helps to confirm the size and production potential of the reservoir, and pave the way for further exploration and production activities.</p>

		<h1> Volumetric Reserve Estimation </h1>
		<p>Volumetric reserve estimation involves using geological data on the porosity and thickness of the reservoir rock, as well as data on the gas content of the rock, to estimate the gas reserves in the well. This method is based on the assumption that the reservoir rock has a uniform porosity and gas content, which may not always be the case in practice. However, it has the advantage of being relatively simple and easy to apply, and can be used to estimate reserves for both volatile and non-volatile reservoirs.</p>

				<h1>Material Balance</h1>
				<p>Material balance analysis is a technique used to estimate the recoverable reserves of a well by analyzing data on the composition of the gas, reservoir pressure and temperature, and well characteristics. It is based on the principles of mass and energy conservation, and uses PVT data, reservoir data, fluid properties, and well production data to estimate the original oil and gas in place, and the amounts that will be produced over time. It can be useful for estimating reserves for both volatile and non-volatile reservoirs, but requires detailed and accurate data on the reservoir and well characteristics.
</p>
<h2>Production History Data</h2>
<p>The data presented in the table shows the measurement of various parameters over a period of time. It includes the date, pressure (P) measured in pounds per square inch gauge (psig), gas production (Gp) measured in billion standard cubic feet (BSCF), and water production (Wp) measured in million standard cubic feet (MMSTB). The data appears to be taken at regular intervals, with measurements recorded every four months from January 2001 to September 2004. The table can be used to analyze trends in pressure, gas production, and water production over the specified period.</p>

<h2>History Matching</h2>
<p>In History Matching Plot four types of graph Graphical Method, Analytical Method, Wd Plot and Energy Plot to determine the reservoir performance according to our data and determine the drive mechanism of reservoir.</p>
<div class="mb-images">
	<h2>Analytical Method</h2>
				<p>In this plot two lines are present one is red and other is blue red line shows production without water influx and blue line shows production with water influx. On X-axis is Calculated Gas production in Bscf and on Y axis pressure in Psig. Both lines red and blue is very close to each other’s this indicate that that the aquifer support is very weak to maintain its pressure in the reservoir during production also thus shows that the drive mechanism of this reservoir is other than water drive. </p>

<!-- Decline Curve Analysis-->
<div class="dca-main   box" id="DCA">
	<div class="dca">
					<h1>Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) </h1>
					<p>Declined curve analysis involves using production data from the well to model the decline in production over time and estimate the ultimate recovery of the well. This method is widely used in the oil and gas industry and has the advantage of being based on actual production data, which can be more reliable than estimates based on geology or reservoir characteristics. However, <span>it relies on the assumption that the decline in production follows a predictable pattern, which may not always be the case in practice.</span> By analyzing the decline rate and initial production rate, the decline curve analysis allows the estimation of future production rate. A decline curve model was fitted using production data collected for the well over a period of time. The model takes into account the decline in production due to the depletion of the reservoir, as well as any changes in well performance or operating conditions.</p>
					<h2>Production History Data</h2>
					<p>This table appears to show a dataset of natural gas production, measured in million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d), and the cumulative production (gp), in trillions of cubic feet (tcf), over a period of several years. The data is organized by date, with measurements taken every four months (on January 1st and May 1st) for four years, from 2001 to 2004.It shows that the gas production is going down over the year and the cumulative production is increasing with time.</p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>
								Overall, our analysis suggests that the GH-01 well has a significant potential for gas 
production, with estimated reserves ranging from 1180 to 1249 Bscf, depending on the 
method used. However, it is important to note that these estimates are subject to various 
assumptions and limitations, including the quality of the data and the accuracy of the models 
applied. For example, the declined curve analysis assumes that the decline in production 
follows a predictable pattern, the material balance requires detailed and accurate data on the 
reservoir and well characteristics, and the volumetric reserve estimation assumes that the 
reservoir rock has a uniform porosity and gas content.
